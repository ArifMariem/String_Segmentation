# Custom MNIST Digit Dataset and SSD MobileNet Model

This repository contains the code and resources for generating a custom dataset of MNIST digits with multiple digits in each image. The dataset was annotated to define bounding boxes for each digit. Using this annotated dataset, a pre-trained SSD MobileNet model was trained and fine-tuned to recognize each digit and draw a bounding box around it in the images.

## Dataset Generation and Annotation

The dataset was generated by combining multiple MNIST digit images into single images. Annotations were manually created to define bounding boxes for each digit in the images. The dataset includes images and corresponding annotation files.

## Model Training

The pre-trained SSD MobileNet model was fine-tuned using the custom dataset. The training process involved optimizing the model's parameters to improve its accuracy in recognizing digits and drawing bounding boxes around them.


## Evaluation

The trained model can be evaluated using standard evaluation metrics for object detection, such as mean Average Precision (mAP) and Intersection over Union (IoU).

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow

## Acknowledgements

- The SSD MobileNet model is based on the TensorFlow Object Detection API.
